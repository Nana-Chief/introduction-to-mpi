title: "Parallellising a Serial Code"
teaching: 30
exercises: 30
questions:
- "What is the best way to write a parallel code?"
- "How do I parallellise my serial code?"
objectives:
- "Go through practical steps for going from a serial code to a parallel code"
- "Allow students to work on their own code or on example codes"
keypoints:
- "Start from a working serial code"
- "Write a parallel implementation for each function or parallel region"
- "Connect the parallel regions with a minimal amount of communication"
- "Continuously compare with the working serial code"
