title: "Serial and Parallel Regions"
teaching: 20
exercises: 20
questions:
- "When is parallel computing useful?"
- "How fast can my code run?"
objectives:
- "Understanding theoretical limitations on parallel algorithms"
keypoints:
- "Algorithms can have parallellisable and non-parallellisable sections"
- "A highly parallel algorithm may be slower on a single processor"
- "The theoretical maximum speed is determined by the serial sections"
- "The other main restruction is communication speed between the processes"
