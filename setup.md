title: Setup
---

Make sure you can compile your a program using a C, C++ or an development environment. You will need to install the MPI (Message Passing Interface) library. Several implementations of MPI exist, but for example, OpenMPI will work.

On Ubuntu install openmpi using
```
sudo apt install openmpi-bin openmpi-common openmpi-doc
```
{: .source .language-bash}

On Os X you can install openmpi for the command line using [homebrew](https://brew.sh). After installing homebrew, run
```
brew install open-mpi
```
{: .source .language-bash}


On Windows, you can install [Microsoft MPI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/message-passing-interface/microsoft-mpi) for Visual studio
