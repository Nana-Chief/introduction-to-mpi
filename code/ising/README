fix s(iup(i,1))+s(iup(i,2))+s(idn(i,1))+s(idn(i,2)) part.
calculation is done twice, which is unnecessary.
define staple = s(iup(i,1))+s(iup(i,2))+s(idn(i,1))+s(idn(i,2)) then
reuse it.

current alogrithm uses two stencil method but it may have ergocity
problem, i.e., the alogrithm moves the system just between two configurations. 

assumes Linux environment for random number routine (erand48()).

for FORTRAN, ranf.c needs to be compiled and linked to FORTRAN progam.
